# Minomy

### Simple, functional JavaScript library for Ethereum micropayments

Minomy uses the Ethereum contracts from [Machinomy](https://github.com/machinomy/machinomy) for unidirectional payment channels to send ether (and soon!) ERC-20 tokens. Whereas Minomy is designed around a minimal and stateless API, the Machinomy Node.js library provides more features, such as database integration and web monetization. Choose what's best for your app!
